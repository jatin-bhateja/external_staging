8248830: C2: Optimize Rotate API on x86.
Summary: Improved existing scalar rotate operations, added support for vector rotate operations using new AVX512 instructions.
[X86] Optimizing arraycopy operations using AVX512 masked moves:-
    -  Adding new AVX512 optimized stubs with special handling for small copy blocks upto 192 bytes and a destination 
       aligned PRE-MAIN-POST loop for copy sizes greater than 192 bytes.
    -  All the special cases and aligned loop  use 32 byte [masked] vectors.
    -  For copy sizes above AVX3Threshold (4096 bytes default), special cases and aligned loop use 64 byte [masked] vectors.
    -  For MaxVectorSize = 32, REP MOVS are use for copy sizes above 4096 bytes.
    -  Partial inlining is done for copy block size less than 32 bytes (default). This makes sure we do not incur the
       call overhead for small sized copy operations. Inline size is configurable through new runtime flag 
       ArrayCopyPartialInlineSize=(32/64).
