-Xlog Usage: -Xlog[:[selections][:[output][:[decorators][:output-options]]]]
	 where 'selections' are combinations of tags and levels of the form tag1[+tag2...][*][=level][,...]
	 NOTE: Unless wildcard (*) is specified, only log messages tagged with exactly the tags specified will be matched.

Available log levels:
 off, trace, debug, info, warning, error

Available log decorators: 
 time (t), utctime (utc), uptime (u), timemillis (tm), uptimemillis (um), timenanos (tn), uptimenanos (un), hostname (hn), pid (p), tid (ti), level (l), tags (tg)
 Decorators can also be specified as 'none' for no decoration.

Available log tags:
 add, age, alloc, annotation, aot, arguments, attach, barrier, biasedlocking, blocks, bot, breakpoint, bytecode, cds, census, class, classhisto, cleanup, codecache, compaction, compilation, constantpool, constraints, container, coops, cpu, cset, data, datacreation, dcmd, decoder, defaultmethods, director, dump, ergo, event, exceptions, exit, fingerprint, free, freelist, gc, handshake, hashtables, heap, humongous, ihop, iklass, init, inlining, interpreter, itables, jfr, jit, jni, jvmti, liveness, load, loader, logging, malloc, mark, marking, membername, memops, metadata, metaspace, methodcomparator, mirror, mmu, module, monitorinflation, monitormismatch, nestmates, nmethod, normalize, objecttagging, obsolete, oldobject, oom, oopmap, oops, oopstorage, os, pagesize, parser, patch, path, perf, periodic, phases, plab, preorder, preview, promotion, protectiondomain, ptrqueue, purge, redefine, ref, refine, region, reloc, remset, resolve, safepoint, sampling, scavenge, setting, smr, stackmap, stacktrace, stackwalk, start, startuptime, state, stats, stringdedup, stringtable, subclass, survivor, sweep, symboltable, system, table, task, test, thread, time, timer, tlab, tracking, unload, unshareable, update, verification, verify, vmmonitor, vmoperation, vmthread, vtables, vtablestubs, workgang
 Specifying 'all' instead of a tag combination matches all tag combinations.

Described tag sets:
 logging: Logging for the log framework itself

Available log outputs:
 stdout/stderr
 file=<filename>
  If the filename contains %p and/or %t, they will expand to the JVM's PID and startup timestamp, respectively.
  Additional output-options for file outputs:
   filesize=..  - Target byte size for log rotation (supports K/M/G suffix). If set to 0, log rotation will not trigger automatically, but can be performed manually (see the VM.log DCMD).
   filecount=.. - Number of files to keep in rotation (not counting the active file). If set to 0, log rotation is disabled. This will cause existing log files to be overwritten.

Some examples:
 -Xlog
	 Log all messages up to 'info' level to stdout with 'uptime', 'levels' and 'tags' decorations.
	 (Equivalent to -Xlog:all=info:stdout:uptime,levels,tags).

 -Xlog:gc
	 Log messages tagged with 'gc' tag up to 'info' level to stdout, with default decorations.

 -Xlog:gc,safepoint
	 Log messages tagged either with 'gc' or 'safepoint' tags, both up to 'info' level, to stdout, with default decorations.
	 (Messages tagged with both 'gc' and 'safepoint' will not be logged.)

 -Xlog:gc+ref=debug
	 Log messages tagged with both 'gc' and 'ref' tags, up to 'debug' level, to stdout, with default decorations.
	 (Messages tagged only with one of the two tags will not be logged.)

 -Xlog:gc=debug:file=gc.txt:none
	 Log messages tagged with 'gc' tag up to 'debug' level to file 'gc.txt' with no decorations.

 -Xlog:gc=trace:file=gctrace.txt:uptimemillis,pid:filecount=5,filesize=1m
	 Log messages tagged with 'gc' tag up to 'trace' level to a rotating fileset of 5 files of size 1MB,
	 using the base name 'gctrace.txt', with 'uptimemillis' and 'pid' decorations.

 -Xlog:gc::uptime,tid
	 Log messages tagged with 'gc' tag up to 'info' level to output 'stdout', using 'uptime' and 'tid' decorations.

 -Xlog:gc*=info,safepoint*=off
	 Log messages tagged with at least 'gc' up to 'info' level, but turn off logging of messages tagged with 'safepoint'.
	 (Messages tagged with both 'gc' and 'safepoint' will not be logged.)

 -Xlog:disable -Xlog:safepoint=trace:safepointtrace.txt
	 Turn off all logging, including warnings and errors,
	 and then enable messages tagged with 'safepoint' up to 'trace' level to file 'safepointtrace.txt'.
