- Each operand has a linked register class and allocator assigns one register to operand from registers associated with that class.
- Constraint are used to link operand to register class only used by ADLC not emitted in output_c/h.cpp
- register mask are linked to machine operands.
- matcher DFA creates result, left and right operands for a MachNode based on tables reduceOp, leftOp and rightOp.
- production / rule selection during labelling phase is based on predicates and costs.
- One MachOper for each operand...
   - Match for operand is against ideal_reg associated with Type* and Ideal Nodes..
- One MachNode for each instruction selection pattern.
- Bool and Ideal Register are matched against operands.
